        Does exactly what parent func does, but the routes are sorted, because
        starlette iterates over routes and performs regex matching until a match is
        found. This means that more general routes might be matched before the specific
        variants, which is not what we want.

        Incoming request on path:
        /registry/registry.com/repository/ubi8/python39/tag/tag1

        /registry/{registry}/repository/{repository}
            ^ if not correctly sorted this will get matched first,
